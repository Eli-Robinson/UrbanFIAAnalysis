<h1 class="title toc-ignore">Spatial Distribtuion of Urban Tree
Species</h1>

<div id="intro-and-past-work" class="section level2">
<h2>Intro and Past Work</h2>
<p>Trees have a major effect on cities being able to reduce urban heat
island effect, mitigate air pollution, improve drainage, and provide
health benefits to humans (Speak, 2018; Wolf, 2020). Every tree however,
provides different services at different levels. Each tree species
provides a different value of ecosystem service to the environment it is
in and specific tree species are often overlooked when urban tree
studies are performed. It is important to understand the spatial
distribution of these urban trees across urban areas and across
different socioeconomic groups in order to understand if there is
inequality in a city based on urban trees in order to inform policy
makers and allocate resources in order to prevent this ecological
inequality.</p>
<p>Previous research has been done in this area of study including
studies that measured canopy cover related to urban heat (Mcdonald,
2021). This study measured the differences between overall tree cover
and urban heat and found that with less tree cover there is more heat.
Then expanded that to include socioeconomic factors as well. Another
study measured green spaces compared to socioeconomic conditions (Li,
2015) and found that areas in worse socioeconomic conditions have less
green spaces or green values. Both of these studies and similar other
studies use satellite imagery, The first through landsat imagery and the
second through google imagery. These methods are good for getting an
overall picture but sometimes can miss specific details and key
information such as tree species. Based on previous work of the FIA
which mapped forests, this program is now working to collect data for
trees in urban areas which is the main focus of this study.</p>
</div>
<div id="methods" class="section level2">
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Two data sets that were used for this study: the first is census
block group information from 2020 US Census Bureau American Community
Survey (Manson, 2022) focusing on average household income. Census block
group is the finest resolution data that has the average household
income so that it was used for this study.</p>
<p>The Urban Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) dataset (Edgar, 2021)
is a relatively new dataset of urban trees. This dataset differs from
the previous because instead of collecting the data with satellite
imagery, data is collected by surveyors on the ground. This allows for
additional information to be collected including diameter of a tree,
height, calculated biomass, condition of tree, and tree species. Tree
species were used in this study in order to understand if different tree
species appear more frequently in high and low income areas. This is the
first federal program which conducts representative studies and data
collection. This data set contains a set of tree and plot data that
contains information about urban trees including location, species,
condition, and much more with both measured and calculated values. This
dataset has information for 10 cities (Austin, TX; Chicago, IL; Houston,
TX; Kansas City, MO; Portland, OR; San Antonio, TX; San Diego, CA;
Springfield, MO; St. Louis, MO; Washington DC) across the US which will
be the areas of focus for this study.</p>
<p>The goal of the project was to associate each tree with a local
income from the data of surrounding neighborhoods. In order to do this
The Urban FIA data has trees within plots, which have location values
associated with them. In order to conduct spatial analysis on tree
information it is necessary to combine this information at some point.
First, however, we must find the average household income associated
with each plot. The divulged coordinates of FIA plots are only accurate
to within 1 km. To account for this, we buffered each plot by 1 km. We
intersected the resulting buffer with the census block groups and
averaged the income, weighted by the census block group area that was
within the buffer. Then dissolve by plot. This results in the area of
the buffered plot with the information of the weighted local census
information. The final step is to merge the plots back to the trees.
This gives each tree both a geometry of their plot location and the
average household income of the nearby block groups. The final result is
a dataset of trees which has species name from the original dataset and
local income value from the spatial analysis.</p>
</div>
<div id="results" class="section level2">
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In order to display results we plotted the 5 most common tree species
in a city by the mean local income found via the spatial analysis. This
will give an understanding of some of the common tree species in each
city and how they relate to the local income.</p>
<p>These first two graphs of Austin, Texas and San Antonio, Texas are
quite similar. Four of the five most common trees in the city are shared
between the two, and each show similar results, with sugar berry on the
low end, cedar elm towards the middle of the income and, ashe juniper
and live oak towards the higher end of the average local income. The
graph of San Antonio shows one potentially large error with the
methodology that should be resolved with future work. There are a few
trees at a zero value for mean local income. This is not due to being in
an area where people do not earn money but rather the trees are in areas
where there are no people living. This could be business districts that
are not zoned for living, parks and natural lands, or government
buildings that have a relatively small block group size.</p>
<p>When looking at the graph of Springfield, Missouri there are two
things that stand out. The first is that all five of the common trees
appear to be in the same income brackets. The other is that due to
Springfield being a small city the mean local incomes of this city are
much lower than some of the other cities that have been shown.</p>
<p>In Washington D.C. there is a difference between the common tree
species with many american beech trees in wealthy areas and red maples
and white oak in the lower income areas. This graph shows a good spread
between all of the different species.</p>
</div>
<div id="discussion" class="section level2">
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>The results of this study provide valuable insights into the
relationship between income and tree species in urban areas. While
similar studies have found that income is often a predictor of tree
cover, with low-income neighborhoods having less tree cover than
higher-income neighborhoods, these results are able to dive deeper into
the nuance of tree species. In these urban areas by showing that certain
tree species tend to be more common in high-income areas, while other
species are more commonly found in low-income areas.</p>
<p>All trees are not the same and different species of trees provide
different ecosystem services. (Do you think I should give specific
examples?) Some trees provide more drainage, or shade, or other factors
and different trees will affect the ecosystem and the city in different
ways. These findings are particularly interesting because they shed
light on potential inequities in urban forestry and urban tree
management and could highlight the need for a more equitable
distribution of trees. Understanding the patterns of inequities is
crucial for improving environmental and social equity in urban
areas.</p>
<p>One of the species that commonly appear in low income areas,
especially in Texas, is the sugarberry tree. The sugarberry tree is a
tree that is native to the southeast United States and is a short to
medium sized tree that grows fast and can grow in a variety of soil
types and conditions. This makes the sugarberry a very opportunistic
tree as it is able to gain hold and grow in a variety of environments.
The sugar berry tree being a small tree provides less tree cover, and
environmental benefits than a larger and potentially more desirable
tree. One such tree that appears in these Texas urban environments is
the live oak tree. The live oak tree is a deep rooted species which can
help prevent erosion, and its larger size in width and increased leaf
areas provide additional tree cover.</p>
<p>One possible explanation for these patterns is that tree planting and
maintenance programs may be more common in higher-income neighborhoods.
Additionally, preferences for certain tree species may differ among
different income groups. For example, some high-income neighborhoods may
prefer to plant ornamental trees for aesthetic purposes, while
low-income neighborhoods may prioritize trees that provide more tangible
benefits such as shade and improved air quality.</p>
<p>The implications of these findings are significant. Different trees
provide a wider range of benefits such as improved air quality, reduced
energy use, and enhanced mental health. However, not all communities
have equal access to these benefits. By identifying and addressing
potential inequities in tree cover, we can work towards creating more
sustainable and equitable urban environments.</p>
<p>Future research could further explore the underlying casues of these
patterns and identify potential solutions for improving equitable access
to trees in urban areas. Additionally, continued monitoring and data
collection efforts such as the Urban FIA program can help inform
management and policy decisions.</p>
</div>
<div id="future-work-conclusion" class="section level2">
<h2>Future Work + Conclusion</h2>
<p>Some future research can be done based off of this work. One thing
that could be done is to fully map out the ecosystem service and
disservice of each tree species. This could be done by creating a model
based on literature such as Bolund, 2017 and other papers which can help
to determine how valuable a tree is to the urban environment based on a
variety of factors. This could assign some kind of tree service
disservice value and help to better understand a connection between
ecosystem services and disservice that is more in depth than tree
species.</p>
<p>Another piece of research that could be done is to use different
information within the FIA data. The Urban FIA data has many different
variables which are all interesting and could each have individual
studies on them. These studies could also make more sense across a
broader scope of cities as tree species are generally most determined by
environment rather than other factors such as tree height or condition,
which are affected but not drastically different city by city.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the socioeconomic patterns of urban tree species
provide valuable insights into the complex relationship between cities
and nature. By examining what different tree species are distributed
across urban areas and their correlation with various socioeconomic
factors, we can gain a deeper understanding of the ways in which urban
trees impact an urban ecosystem. This information can inform urban
planning and management strategies, allowing us to create more equitable
and sustainable urban environments.</p>
