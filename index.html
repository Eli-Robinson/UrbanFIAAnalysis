<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>This study aimed to understand if there was a connection between tree
species and income levels in ten different cities in the US, using data
from the Urban Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) dataset and
demographic information from the 2020 US Census Bureau American
Community Survey at the census block group level. The Urban FIA dataset
provides detailed information on urban trees, including diameter,
height, condition, biomass, and species. The study used spatial analysis
to investigate associations between tree species and the average
household income of the surrounding neighborhood. The results showed
that tree species occurrence varied with local income, with some species
appearing more frequently in high-income areas, while others were more
common in low-income areas. The ecosystem services and disservices
provided by trees vary among species, implying associations between
neighborhood income and both positive and negative human-plant
interactions. These results provide a path towards understanding
tree-related inequity in American cities and future research on this
topic could help inform policy and tree management decisions that aim to
reduce ecological inequity.</p>
</div>
<div id="introduction" class="section level2">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Trees have major effects on cities by reducing urban heat island
effect, mitigate air pollution, improve drainage, and provide health
benefits to humans (Speak, 2018; Wolf, 2020). Every tree, however,
provides different services. Each tree species provides a different
value of ecosystem service to the environment it is in, and differences
among tee species are often overlooked when urban tree studies are
performed. For example, certain woods and trees provide different
abilities to filter air pollution (Chen 2017), have different cooling
potentials (Rahman, 2020), and have different pollen exposure risks
(Sousa-Silva, 2021). It is important to understand the spatial
distribution of these urban trees across urban areas and across
different socioeconomic groups in order to understand if there are
differences in tree composition as a function of neighborhood demography
(e.g., income). Differences in tree composition as a function of income
could result in inequity in the ecosystem services and disservices
provided by urban trees. Understanding any such inequity in tree
composition is the first step towards potential policy and management
goals of reducing inequity in the services provided by trees.</p>
<p>Previous research has been done in this area of study including
studies that measured canopy cover related to urban heat (McDonald,
2021). This study measured the differences between overall tree cover
and urban heat and found that with less tree cover there is more heat.
McDonald et al. found that tree cover was also correlated with
socioeconomic factors. Another study compared green spaces to
socioeconomic conditions (Li, 2015) and found that areas of lower
socioeconomic status had fewer green spaces. These studies and many
similar studies use imagery to quantify tree cover (e.g., Landsat
imagery or Google Street View). These methods are good for quantifying
green spaces or tree cover but are unable to provide key information on
tree species composition.</p>
<p>Anecdotal evidence suggests that tree species composition varies
across income levels within cities, however this has not been
systematically assessed across cities. If so, this could have
implications for the ecosystem services and disservices provided by
trees, which could have policy and management implications. A new
program, the Urban Forest Inventory and Analysis (UFIA) is measuring
trees in urban areas and provides the first systematic and uniform
dataset that could be used to compare tree identity and neighborhood
demography in cities across the United States. Here, I combine UFIA and
data from the US Census Bureau to quantify associations between tree
species and income levels in 10 cities in the United States.</p>
</div>
<div id="methods" class="section level2">
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Two data sets that were used for this study: the first is census
block group information from 2020 US Census Bureau American Community
Survey (Manson, 2022) focusing on average household income. Census block
group is the finest resolution data that has the average household
income so that it was used for this study. The census variable used for
this study is AMRE8001 which is the median household income in the past
12 months (in 2020 inflation-adjusted dollars).</p>
<p>The UFIA dataset (Edgar, 2021) is a relatively new dataset of urban
trees. This dataset differs from the remote sensing data that several
studies have used to compare to socioeconomic data because the UFIA data
is collected by surveyors on the ground. This allows for additional
information to be collected including diameter of a tree, height,
calculated biomass, condition of tree, and tree species. This is the
first federal program which conducts representative studies and data
collection of trees in urban areas. This data set contains a set of tree
and plot data that contains information about urban trees including
location, species, condition, and much more with both measured and
calculated values. This dataset has information for 10 cities (Austin,
TX; Chicago, IL; Houston, TX; Kansas City, MO; Portland, OR; San
Antonio, TX; San Diego, CA; Springfield, MO; St. Louis, MO; Washington
DC) across the US which will be the areas of focus for this study.
Additional UFIA censuses are currently ongoing in 34 other cities.</p>
<p>The goal of the project was to investigate associations between tree
species occurrence and neighborhood income. In order to do this the UFIA
data has trees within plots, which have location values associated with
them. In order to conduct spatial analysis on tree information it is
necessary to combine this information at some point. First, however, I
must find the average household income associated with each plot. The
divulged coordinates of UFIA plots are only accurate to within 1 km. To
account for this, I buffered each plot by 1 km. I intersected the
resulting buffer with the census block groups and averaged the income,
weighted by the census block group area that was within the buffer. Then
I dissolved by plot. This results in the area of the buffered plot with
the information of the weighted local census information. Census
information for the buffered area was then merged with the UFIA tree
data. This gives each tree both a geometry of their plot location and
the average household income of the nearby block groups. </p>
<p>The result is a dataset of trees which has species name from the
original dataset and local income value from the spatial analysis. In
order to display results, I plotted the 5 most common tree species in a
city by the mean local income found via the spatial analysis. This will
give an understanding of some of the common tree species in each city
and how they relate to the local income. I also mapped the plots across
the city colored by species in order to better understand the spatial
context of each city. To test whether tree occurrence varied among
income levels I used an ANOVA and then a Tukey’s HSD (honestly
significant difference) test.</p>
<p>This analysis was done in Python 3 using the Pandas and Geopandas
libraries for spatial analysis and Seaborn for plotting and
visualization, SciPy for statistics, NumPy for arithmetic, as well as
other small libraries for easy access. The codebook can be found here on
the website (<a

and also on the public GitHub repository (<a

can be cloned for further research.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In order to display results we plotted the 5 most common tree species
in a city by the mean local income found via the spatial analysis. This
will give an understanding of some of the common tree species in each
city and how they relate to the local income.</p>

Fig. 1 shows a map of San Antonio with the plots where the five most
common species are. This map shows many Ashe juniper (<em>Juniperus
ashei</em>) trees in the northern areas of the city and many honey
mesquite trees (<em>Prosopis glandulosa</em>) on the southern block of
the city with sugarberry, (<em>Celtis laevigata</em>) and cedar elm
(<em>Ulmus crassifolia</em>) more in the center and downtown areas and
live oak (<em>Quercus virginiana</em>) seems to have been spread around
the entire city. This map and others of different cities can help to
provide additional context for the following results.</p>

<p>These first two graphs of Austin, Texas (Fig. 2) and San Antonio,

<p>When looking at the graph of Springfield, Missouri there are two
things that stand out. The first is that all five of the common trees
appear to be in the same income brackets. The other is that due to
Springfield being a small city the mean local incomes of this city are
much lower than some of the other cities that have been shown.</p>

<div id="discussion" class="section level2">
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>The results of this study provide valuable insights into the
relationship between income and tree species in urban areas. While
similar studies have found that income is often a predictor of tree
cover, with low-income neighborhoods having less tree cover than
higher-income neighborhoods (McDonald, 2021; Li, 2015), the results
presented here provide the nuance of tree species identity. In these
urban areas, certain tree species tend to be more common in high-income
areas, while other species are more commonly found in low-income
areas.</p>
<p>All trees are not the same and different species of trees provide
different ecosystem services such as trees with thicker leaves and
denser foliage provide increased shading, and tree wood anatomy can
provide increased transpiration. (Rahman, 2019). Different trees provide
a wider range of benefits such as improved air quality, reduced energy
use, and enhanced mental health. These differences in tree composition
are therefore likely to affect the ecosystem services and disservices
provided in rich vs poor neighborhoods; this work suggests that not all
communities have equal access to these benefits. The findings in this
study are particularly interesting because they shed light on potential
inequities in urban forestry and urban tree management and highlight the
need for a more equitable distribution of trees. Understanding the
patterns of inequities is a crucial first step towards any eventual
policy or management goals for improving environmental and social equity
in urban areas.</p>
<p>One example of species that commonly appear in low-income areas,
especially in Texas, is the sugarberry tree, Celtis laevigata
(Willdenow). The sugarberry tree is a tree that is native to the
southeast United States and is a short to medium sized tree that grows
fast and can grow in a variety of soil types and conditions. This makes
the sugarberry a very opportunistic tree as it can gain hold and grow in
a variety of environments. The sugar berry tree being a small tree
provides less tree cover, and environmental benefits than a larger and
potentially more desirable tree. One such tree that appears in these
Texas urban environments is the live oak tree. The live oak tree is a
deep-rooted species which can help prevent erosion, and its larger size
in width and increased leaf areas provide additional tree cover. This is
just one example and there are similar species in high and low income
areas in other cities as well.</p>
<p>Urban trees tend to shift more towards these invasive or
opportunistic species when tree planting and management decrease (Nowak,
2012). One possible explanation for the patterns found here is that the
tree planting and maintenance programs may be more common in
higher-income neighborhoods which could create a disparity between
neighborhoods of different socioeconomic status.</p>
<p>There are some limitations with the current methods. One of the
limitations is data clustering, which is when there are many trees of
the same species with the same value for mean local income. This occurs
when there are many trees of the same species in one plot. Since the
income is assigned by plot. All the trees are given the same mean local
income which can cluster the data; future work should correct for this
by including a random effect for plot within each city. Another
limitation is the necessary one-kilometer buffering because the UFIA
plot coordinates are intentionally jittered by up to 1 km. This
buffering of the plots creates a larger range of incomes that are
aggregated which in turn could create some inaccuracies of local income.
These limitations are due to the nature of data collection and should be
kept in mind but should not be detrimental to the study. In some cases,
there are a few trees at a zero value for mean local income (e.g., in
San Antonio). This is not due to being in an area where people have an
income of zero but rather the trees are in areas where there are no
people living. This could be business districts that are not zoned for
living, parks and natural lands, or government buildings that have a
relatively small block group size.</p>
<p>Future research could further explore the underlying causes of these
patterns and identify potential solutions for improving equitable access
to trees in urban areas. Additionally, continued monitoring and data
collection efforts such as the UFIA program can help inform management
and policy decisions.  One example of future research that can be done
based off this work is to fully map out the ecosystem service and
disservice of each tree species. Creating a model based on literature
such as Bolund, 2017 and other papers which can help to determine how
valuable a tree is to the urban environment based on a variety of
factors. This could assign the service and disservices provided by trees
of each species and help to elucidate the connection between
neighborhood demography, tree composition, and ecosystem services and
disservices. Another piece of research that could be done is to use
different information within the UFIA data. The UFIA data has many
different variables which are all interesting and could each have
individual studies on them. These studies could also make more sense
across a broader scope of cities as tree species are generally most
determined by environment rather than other factors such as tree height
or condition, which are affected but may not be drastically different
city by city.</p>
<p>In conclusion, species of trees in urban areas of the United States
are associated with income, with some species corresponding to higher
and some corresponding to lower income areas. This difference may result
in different ecosystem services provided by trees, including pollen
levels, amount of shade, and air filtration. Understanding where these
differences lie is the first step towards ensuring each neighborhood has
equal access and resources to the environmental services that all
different tree species provide.</p>
